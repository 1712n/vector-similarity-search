## Contributing

⚠️ **Important: Please don't contribute code directly — we use [**WALL-E**](https://github.com/1712n/wall-e) to automatically generate code from the spec file. If you'd like to contribute, focus on improving the spec file, not the code!**

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch  
3. Edit the spec file  
4. Open a pull request to this repository  
5. Trigger [**WALL-E**](https://github.com/1712n/wall-e) to generate the code from your updated spec file using the [`/wall-e generate`](https://github.com/1712n/wall-e?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage) command.

This approach helps keep the project clean, safe, and easy to maintain. We enforce it with a `CODEOWNERS` file, branch protection rules, and pull request reviews.
